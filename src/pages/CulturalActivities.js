          Cultural activities are much more beneficial than they seem. These
          activities play a vital role in shaping the passion and interest of
          the students, apart from the academics. Time management,
          self-exploration, personal growth, improved self-esteem; We believes
          that indulging in such activities teaches the real-time aspects of
          life.
