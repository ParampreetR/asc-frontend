          Whoever adopts teaching as a profession assumes the obligation to
          conduct him/her in accordance with the ideal of the profession. A
          teacher is constantly under the scrutiny of his students and the
          society at large. Therefore, every teacher should see that there is no
          incompatibility between his precepts and practice. The National ideals
          of education which have already been set forth and which he/she should
          seek to inculcate among students must be his/her own ideals. The
          profession further requires that the teachers should be calm, patient
          and communicative by temperament and amiable in disposition.
