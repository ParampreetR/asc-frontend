          initial stints spanning five years (1989-1994) in premier institutions
          in Punjab and Haryana provided him the fusion of professional training
          with University education, a step towards the fulfillment of
          long-cherished dream of entering teaching profession since his
          graduation years. Later on, he worked as Lecturer for two years (July
          1995-June 1997) at Shanti Tara College, Ahmedgarh and simultaneously

          Patiala. On basis of his achievements and demonstrated success in
          teaching-learning, academics, research and corporate life of the
          institution, he was selected as the youngest ever Principal of this
          pre-independence College in March 2005 and is still continuing on this
          position. The professional experience, skills and significant shifts
          harnessed while navigating the professional journey of over 26 years

          The academic career, teaching philosophy and pedagogical stance have
          been shaped under the influence of his mentors who always led by an
          example inside and outside the classroom. He is strongly of the
          opinion that a teacher must be fully devoted to the institution so
          that the desired graduate attributes are fully achieved and the
          students develop an ability to adequately assess, create, and
          articulate different ideas. In this context, the teaching of English
          as a Compulsory/Elective Subject has had been a challenging task in
          our institution where more than 50% students are ruralites from about
          160 villages. After 25 years of college teaching as a
          Lecturer/Principal, he is still experimenting and working on new ideas
          for quality enhancement in UG/PG teaching. The students have always
          considered him as a positive, caring and dedicated teacher who is
          committed for the holistic development of his students. As an
          author/editor, Dr. Jhanji has contributed 06 Books and 12 papers in
          the area of English Literature, Human Security, Environmental Issues
          and Skill Development in Higher Education. He has attended many
          national and international conferences held in India and abroad.
