# Why website loading speed matters?

In today busy world where everyone wants to get maximum benefit with less time spent, websites are no different.

In a 2019 survey by [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/page-speed-report/), nearly 70% of consumers admitted that page speed impacts their willingness to buy from an online retailer. Furthermore, of all the people surveyed, half said they’d be willing to give up animation and video for faster load times.

Additionally, it's crucial to remember the importance of your website's mobile loading speeds. [Jillian Streit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillian-streit), a website strategist at [Blue Frog](https://www.bluefrogdm.com/), told HubSpot: "Page speed has been a ranking factor for many years, and with Google’s shift to mobile-first indexing, it is even more important to focus on your website's mobile loading speeds."

She adds, "Unfortunately, most mobile pages take much longer to load than their desktop counterparts, and mobile users expect pages to load much faster on their mobile devices. If the page takes too long to load, users will immediately bounce, causing your site to lose out on a large number of potential customers."
