# Software Requirment Specification

The software requirment specification is produced at the culmination of the analysis task. The function and performance allocated to software as a part of system engineering are refined by establishing a complete information description, a detailed functional and behavioral description, an indication of performance requirments and design constraints, appropriate validation criteria, and other data pertinent to requirments.



#### The proposed system has the following requirments:



- System need to maintain quantity record.
