## Technical Feasibility

Technical feasibility isÂ the formal process of assessing whether it is technically possible to build a project (product or service). Before launching a new offering or taking up a client project, it is essential to plan and prepare for every step of the operation.

This includes the study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the ability to achieve an acceptable system. For this feasibility study, we studied the complete functionality to be provided in the system, as described in the System Requirements Specification (SRS), and checked if everything was possible using different type of frontend and backend platforms.
