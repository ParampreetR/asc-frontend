# Hardware Requirement Specification

The Hardware Requirements Specification (SRS) captures the complete Hardware requirements for the system, or a portion of the system.

Hardware system requirements often specify the operating system version, processor type, memory size, available disk space and additional peripherals, if any, needed.

#### Hardware Requirements:

- Architecture. All computer operating systems are designed for a particular computer architecture. ...
- Processing power. The power of the central processing unit (CPU) is a fundamental system requirement for any software. ...
- Memory. ...
- Secondary storage. ...
- Display adapter. ...
- Peripherals.

#### Hardware Required:
