# System Design of College Website

In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfils the given requirements. Design phase of software development deals with transforming the clients requirements into a working system. Normally, design is performed in the following in the following two steps:

#### 1. Primary Design Phase:

In this phase, the system is designed at block level. The block are created on the basis of analysis done in the problem identification phase. different blocks are created for different functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information flow between blocks. Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept in one block.

#### 2. Secondary Design Phase:

In the secondary phase the detailed design of every block is performed.

##### The general tasks involved in the design process are the following:

1. Design various blocks for overall system processes.

2. Design smaller, compact and workable modules in each block.

3. Design various database structures.

4. Specify details of programs to achieve desired functionality.

5. Design the form of inputs, and outputs of the system.

6. Perform documentation of the design.

7. System reviews.
