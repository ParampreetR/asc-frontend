SQLite, in a nutshell, is a database with limited capabilities when compared to more sophisticated databases. SQLite, on the other hand, does not require any additional setup or software. It is highly dependent on the file system. To put it another way, all data is saved on a disc as a file. These files are very small in size and can easily be copied and backed up.

As of now, Our website don't use database that heavily. So this is the most appropriate choice among many alternatives.

> The SQLite [file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html) is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it that way [through the year 2050](https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html). SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems [[1]](https://www.sqlite.org/aff_short.html) [[2]](https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar.html) [[3]](https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html) and as a long-term archival format for data [[4]](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html). There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in active use [[5]](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html).
