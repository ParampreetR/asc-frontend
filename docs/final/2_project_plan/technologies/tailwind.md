# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS can be used to create websites in the quickest and easiest way possible.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for quickly creating customised user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that provides you with all of the building blocks you need to create custom designs without any annoying opinionated styles that you must fight to override.
The beauty of tailwind is that it does not impose design specifications or how your site should look; instead, you simply connect tiny components to create a one-of-a-kind user interface.

As example, consider this code

```html
<div class="text-[1.2em]">Hello<div>
```

This will automatically be converted to

```html
<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">Hello<div>
```

This is a beauty of tailwind css.
