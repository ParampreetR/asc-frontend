### Introduction to Existing System

Current system, Multiple page Web Application works on the top of ASP.NET with manually coded CSS.

### Drawbacks of Existing System

- Do not provides any Search Engine Optimization.
- Is not responsive to small screen sizes, example Mobile Phones and tablets.
- Data Inefficient, each page had many similar parts example navigation bar and footer that are separately retrieved for each page.
- Slow as each page of Web Application is loaded from scratch.
- Inconsistence font size, image alignment, navigation buttons placement and many content overflows.

### Advantages of Proposed System

- Provides better Search Engine Optimization.
- Responsive to approximately all screen sizes, including Mobile Phones and tablets.
- Data efficient, similar parts example navigation bar and footer are only retrieved once from server for every page of Web Application.
- Fast because only parts of the existing page are changed dynamically. Entire page is not loaded from scratch.
- Better font sizes, image alignments and navigation buttons placements.
- Better modularity and arrangement of front-end code and back-end code.
- Will try to cache items which are time consuming, so that next time site loads faster.
- Better user friendly experience and appearance.
